# Interstellar Adventure

Interstellar Adventure is VR space flight sim that allows you to travel the void in order to visit planets and explore the stars. Take control of your spacecraft to fly around a solar system and tour its sun and planets.

## About

This is a VR project built in Unity for the Oculus Quest 2. The initial purpose of this project was to demonstrate object interaction in VR. The player takes control of a spacecraft and has the ability to fly around the map. They can interact with the flightstick, buttons, and throttle controls using the Quest controllers. The project utilizes the Unity Physics Engine to move the spacecraft and grab objects.

## Final Notes
